        what 
        when 
        where 
        why
    intro
Meeting two
    Process on how system runs
    order of operations 
Meeting three
    FFT 
    How fft should be applied
    How FFt works
    Componets of FFt
Meeting four
    Pythag along side FFT 
    How long frames should be
    Use an overlap with frames
Meeting five
    Correction implemtation of FFT 
    Further details on how FFT should be applied in the system
    FFT should be input by user not hard coded
    Create .txt file for values for later analysis
Meeting six
    Test that FFT works and correct values returned
    Hamming window 
    Why use hamming window 
    How hamming winow fits into the system
Meeting seven
    Details on additional things to include in extended problem description
    Check that hamming window implemneted correctly and correct values returned
Meeting eight
    Inverse FFT 
    How iFFT works
    Why ifft is used 
    How to calcuate phase of magnitude
    Why we use the phase
Meeting nine
    Method which speech enhancment will be achived
    How spectral subtraction works
Meeting ten
    Details on sections to include in report
    More detials on spectral subtraction 
    New class where system calculates averages and subtracts average
Meeting eleven
    How spectral subtraction should be implemnted into the system
    New array to store new values
Meeting tweleve
    Check that spectral subtraction implemneted correctly
    More details on how spectral subtraction could be implemneted correctly
Meeting Thirteen
    Check that enhanced speech is outputted and correct values outputted
    Further guidance on report
